# Offer inserting dash row

Probably best UX is to be proactive and insert it and display a message with a button to remove it if it was a bad call.
But we also need to remember to not insert it, so probably replace with an HTML comment we recognize as a hint not to insert.
Or just flat out insert it because it's probably mandatory anyway.
